Since its premiere in 1936, this timeless story of an adventurous boy and his animal friends has introduced generations of children to classical music and orchestral instruments. The program will appeal most to children aged 3 to 11 and their parents. Note that doors open at 2:15; tickets are required.</p><p>The American Classical Orchestra (ACO), through its award-winning education program Classical Music for Kids (CMK), brings this enchanting tale to life in a unique chamber arrangement by ACO Artistic Director and Conductor Thomas Crawford. Unlike traditional full-orchestra renditions, this intimate performance features eight instrumentalists—violin, flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, French horn, kettle drums, and piano—each representing a character in the story.</p><p>Mr. Crawford will narrate the tale, accompanied by acclaimed mime Catherine Gasta, who will bring the story to life through expressive movement. Miss Gasta will also lead the audience in interactive mime exercises, making for an engaging and immersive experience.</p><p>Following the 30-minute performance, children and adults can participate in a Q&A session with the artists, explore the workings of their instruments, and discover the art of mime as an acting tool.</p><p>This program is free. It is now open to the Classes of 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010. Click on the hyperlink below exclusive to the Class of 2000 to get tickets.</p><p><a href="https://tickets.princeton.edu/online/seatSelect.asp?createBO::WSmap=1&BOparam::WSmap::loadBestAvailable::performance_ids=C3A55027-632B-4687-9895-ECD40473F516&BOparam::WSmap::loadBestAvailable::promocode_access_code=25ALUMPW00">Class of 2000</a></p><p>We suggest you act as soon as you can. Richardson has a capacity of 832. Four classes alone, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010, will have well more than 1500 children attending Reunions – not including their parents.  There is a limit of six seats per registrant. Where more seats are needed for larger families or grandparents, additional seats are available through the University ticketing system. Contact <a href="mailto:tixhelp@princeton.edu">tixhelp@princeton.edu</a>. PLEASE exercise some restraint in the number of tickets you order, so we can accommodate as many children as possible with the limited seating available. Every empty seat could be accommodating a child, so please do not order more tickets than you expect to use.</p><p>To deepen your appreciation of the live performance, ACO encourages families to watch the ACO’s full-length film of Peter and the Wolf, produced in partnership with The WNET Group (Thirteen). The film is available for free on PBS Learning Media: Watch at <a href="https://ny.pbslearningmedia.org/collection/peter_and_the_wolf/">https://ny.pbslearningmedia.org/collection/peter_and_the_wolf/</a></p><p>See you at the Reunion, May 22-25, 2025</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://reunions.princeton2000.org/letters/registration_week</guid><title>registration_week</title><link>https://reunions.princeton2000.org/letters/registration_week</link><description><![CDATA[Hello 2000, and welcome to WhatsApp!

Don’t worry, even if you don’t know exactly who’s going to be in your group, you can edit your registration later. If you’re interested, we can take 20-30 people tomorrow. Just message me here, and I’ll pass along the link.</p><p>Depending on feedback, we’ll open registration to this group on Wednesday or Thursday.</p><p>Friday, we’ll send a class-wide email with the theme and jacket design and open up registration.</p><p>One very important point is that registration is separate from your class jacket order. Registration runs until May, but with the lead times we need for the jacket, your jacket order must be in by <strong><a href="https://reunions.princeton2000.org/data/OrderMyReunionsJacket.ics">DECEMBER 13, 2024</a></strong>. That is very, very soon. The jacket team made an awesome sizing chart that you can find <a href="https://reunions.princeton2000.org/images/jacket/P2000_25th_Jacket_Sizing_Chart.pdf">here:</a> You can print it out and take it to a tailor or have a friend help.

We want to get a sense of the who, where, when, and how (we’re pretty clear on the what and why). If you have plans, let us know them. If you don’t have plans, let’s start the conversation!<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScONM_ALtuH8QFf9Ztr09NxkplNSlDDsdwJXBZy_2vpWs6o-w/viewform">TAKE THE SURVEY</a></p><p><strong>HOUSING UPDATE</strong></p><p>Hey gang, wanted to get to you all with an update on housing, mostly because Nassau Inn kicks off the frenzy by opening up their reservation window tomorrow (Weds) at 10am ET.</p><p>With the demands of Reunions, housing is a mix of on-campus housing, local hotels, and room available through friendly institutions (e.g. Rider University), not to mention Airbnbs and short-term rentals like that. Here’s a quick overview.</p><p><strong>On-Campus Housing</strong></p><p>The University administers on-campus housing, which you can sign up for when you register for Reunions. It’s not 100% guaranteed – it depends on how many undergrads stay on campus through Reunions – but it is pretty reliably available for major reunions like ours. It is definitely the cheapest option, typically about $150 for a bed for the weekend, but 1) it can be anywhere on campus (potentially without AC), 2) you’ll have a shared bathroom, and 3) you’ll need to provide your own linens (This may be less of an issue as the ‘99s found a rental service to take care of this. We’ll probably use it, but we still need to set that up). Also, the University tries to keep all members of a party together, but can’t promise it.</p><p><strong>Local Hotels</strong></p><p>We have currently reserved about <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1chWYFV69EQlY-L3wMB8wqE0hravAz8YuFYw_Y0W5qkk/edit?gid=0#gid=0">210 rooms</a> across 11 hotels in the area. Most of them were on this year’s Reunions shuttle bus route to and from campus, and most are along Route 1. We’re still gathering booking links to make those reservations, but rates are coming in between $290 and $550 a night, and we have a good mix of bed/occupancy types. We have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1chWYFV69EQlY-L3wMB8wqE0hravAz8YuFYw_Y0W5qkk/edit?gid=0#gid=0">list</a> of local hotels here. We note where we have a group rate, and list the mix of what’s available. Most of the hotels in the area are opening reservations over the next month or so, so this is a living document. The two hotels right downtown, open booking tomorrow. Expect the Nassau Inn to sell out in a couple of hours. The Graduate Hotel is new to the area, and just opened on Nassau Street across from the Rocky dining hall. We’ve been talking to them for 14 months off and on about room blocks, and, well…we wish them and their proposed room rates all the success in the world.</p><p><strong>Friendlies</strong></p><p>We’re still reaching out to the local institutions - Rider College, Westminster Choir College, and Princeton Theological Seminary. They tend to open up later on in the process. Based on the ’99s experience this year, the pricing is a little more than on campus, but they have AC, linens are included, and are on the shuttle route, so a decent value overall.</p><p><strong>Airbnb, Vrbo etc.</strong></p><p>A lot of locals are willing to rent their homes out during Reunions, even some otherwise loyal alumni during an off-year (We missed you this year, Ann!). That inventory can certainly vary and outside of the committee’s domain, but it’s worth checking out as well.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://reunions.princeton2000.org/letters/sponsors_carts</guid><title>sponsors_carts</title><link>https://reunions.princeton2000.org/letters/sponsors_carts</link><description><![CDATA[Sponsorships & Donations]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 19:22:58 -0400</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Princeton 2000]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Class Letters]]></category><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sponsorships & Donations</strong></p><p>Hey gang – We’ve had a couple of people reach out about donations/sponsorships, and I wanted to send out a quick note to clarify. If you’re interested in sponsoring an event or making a beverage donation towards an event, we absolutely welcome it! We’ve got some incredible things planned already, like a smoothie bar and signature cocktails, and while we haven’t historically done sponsorships, several classes have recently, and they have really boosted their reunions. Needless to say, we are always happy to find new ways for the 25th blow everyone away.</p><p>A few caveats - the donation has to be directly from a person, so we can’t have corporate signage (although maybe we could revisit the Nassau 500 theme?). Also, if you want to do a direct donation, e.g. buy wine for a class dinner, we have to help you get a distribution permit for the State of New Jersey. It’s a pretty simple process, but just know it’s not as simple as shipping cases of wine. In any case, if you’re at all interested, please <a href="mailto:katetamalonis@gmail.com">email Kate Tamalonis</a> directly.</p><p><strong>Personal Golf Cart Rentals</strong></p><p>If you will be in need of a golf cart at Reunions, the <a href="https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/golfcart25">order form is now live</a>. Golf cart rentals are only available for Reunions attendees with mobility impairments and alumni with a medical condition or permanent disability. (The University reserves the right to ask for a copy of a state-issued HC ID card, HC license plate or HC placard.). Carts may be in short supply, so if you do reserve one please let our transportation chair, Ashley Martabano, know in advance, and we may be able to help find some efficiencies. Once you fill out the form for personal carts, please <a href="mailto:martabno@alumni.princeton.edu">email Ashley</a> and let her know that you reserved one so we can also keep track of who has ordered and is expecting a cart.</p><p>Order form: <a href="https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/golfcart25">https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/golfcart25</a></p><p>Questions: <a href="golfcart@princeton.edu">golfcart@princeton.edu</a></p><p><strong>Transportation Around Campus</strong></p><p>ADA-accessible TigerTransit buses will operate continuously on the perimeter of campus during Reunions.</p><p>Replacing the limited Rover golf-cart service, new trolley service with designated stops will provide rides along Elm Drive to Chapel Circle, from noon-1 a.m. on Thursday, and from 8-1 a.m. Friday and Saturday. (Due to the P-rade, trolley service on Elm Drive will be suspended from approximately 10 a.m.-6 p.m. on Saturday.) The trolleys are wheelchair-accessible, air-conditioned and can accommodate up to 38 guests.</p><p>Should you need further curbside assistance, please contact the TigerAccess hotline at 609-258-9401 to arrange van service during Reunions. This is a limited, first come, first served accommodation, and advanced reservations are highly recommended.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://reunions.princeton2000.org/letters/registration_kickoff</guid><title>registration_kickoff</title><link>https://reunions.princeton2000.org/letters/registration_kickoff</link><description><![CDATA[Aughty Aught!

I know we’ve said this before, but the more certainty we have around attendance, the more we can commit to making sure you and your guests have a great time. For example, entertainment gets booked pretty far out in advance. If it’s January and we can only afford some dude with an iPod, even if we get a bunch of money in April, the upgrade options just aren’t there. Now, we’ll still have a great time, but if you’re pretty sure you’re coming, commit!</p><p><strong>Class Jacket – <a href="https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00">DECEMBER 13</a></strong></p><p>This is CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

That said, you’re going to want to run to order this thing anyway! The costumes committee NAILED IT. It’s an elegant, timeless design, with several thoughtful details, and, get this, a lightweight fabric that was custom-designed for Reunions.

With a little under two months to Reunions, we’re at about 600 registered classmates, and almost 1,400 total registered guests. We’re going to have an incredible turnout, and it’s going to be so much fun reconnecting for the first time in a long while.</p><p>But we’re not there yet. If you’re on the fence…<a href="https://princeton.reunioniq.com/go/2025/2000">register</a>! If you’re not sure…<em>get</em> sure and <a href="https://princeton.reunioniq.com/go/2025/2000">register</a>! It would be amazing (though not all that surprising) if the Class of 2000 sets the standard for the greatest Reunion of them all.</p><p><strong>Kids’ Guide to Reunions</strong></p><p>When we started Reunions planning two years ago, we heard loud and clear that children can be a significant complicating factor in deciding whether or not to attend Reunions. To help bring down that barrier and get as many of you there as possible, the Committee has been relentlessly focused on making sure that we have a program that is both easy for parents and a blast for kids of all ages.</p><p><a href="https://reunions.princeton2000.org/kids//">Attached is our Kids’ and Parents’ Guide to Reunions</a>. We want to make sure you know what to expect, can make a plan, and get everyone in your party as excited for Reunions as you are…share it with your families and get ready for a party!</p><p><strong>Career Chats</strong></p><p>We have talked a bit about offering “career chats” for our older kids at Reunions. Rather than just listening to us droning on for three days about Princeton, it would be a chance for kids to understand the broad range of things they can do, and how they can start to set those interesting careers in motion. We’re still working it out, but they would likely be quick 20-minute Q&A sessions in one of the open rooms in Whitman over the course of the weekend. If you’re interested in volunteering, we’d love to hear from you! Email me directly to register your interest, we think it will be a refreshing change of pace for our older kids.</p><p><strong>Class Photo</strong></p><p>As you may know, we will take our 25th Reunion photo before the P-Rade at 1pm on Saturday. As you do not know, you can <a href="https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00">pre-order that photo</a> on our <a href="https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00">class store</a>! We just opened it up, and we know you’re going to want a record of the best you’ve ever looked (I’m serious, a bunch of people were talking to me about how good you looked). <a href="https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00">Pick up some swag while you’re there</a>?</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://reunions.princeton2000.org/letters/jacket_reveal</guid><title>jacket_reveal</title><link>https://reunions.princeton2000.org/letters/jacket_reveal</link><description><![CDATA[Hey team – WHOA.

I was about to send this yesterday, but our incredible costumes team told me they had something special…we’ve got the first pics of our jacket! Read to the bottom and get the first sneak peek!</p><p><strong>How can we help you?</strong></p><p>As you can imagine, there are a lot of threads coming together over the next couple of months (77 days). I’m planning on sending out a timeline so you know key dates and when to expect to hear from us, but I may not be capturing everything that’s on your mind. We have a <a href="https://reunions.princeton2000.org/faq/">FAQ</a> page in place, and while we’re keeping it updated, I really want to make sure we’re addressing whatever it will take to get you in particular on campus for Reunions. If anything’s got you on the fence, or if you’re wavering in any way, PLEASE GET IN TOUCH. Our class has earned this Reunion, and WE WANT TO SEE YOU there. If you have an idea that might just be cool (should we have an “arrivals board” to coordinate flights/rides?) GET IN TOUCH!</p><p><a href="https://agchallenge.princeton.edu">Annual Giving – March Participation Challenge!</a></p><p>We just kicked off the March Participation Challenge. Every gift gets a $50 match and we get an extra $10,000 if we have the most gifts of the ’99-’03 cohort. We’re currently in second, 2.5% behind the ‘99s. If that makes you feel the same way it makes me feel…<a href="https://agchallenge.princeton.edu">get your donation in!</a></p><p><strong>Rider Housing Option</strong></p><p>The Housing Committee has done incredible work and has engaged with Rider University for additional affordable options for Reunions. Rider is on the shuttle route, right in Lawrenceville. They’ve offered us two sets of room configurations in their Beckett Village dormitory:</p><ul><li>Double Occupancy Bedroom w/ Bath - $200/bed. 2 single beds in one room with private bath, air-conditioned. (Cost per bed assumes double occupancy. Cost would double for single occupancy in these rooms.)</li><li>Single Occupancy (single bedroom in shared suite) - $250/bed. Single bedroom dormitory accommodations within a 3-4 room suite with a common suite entrance, shared sitting area and bathroom, and air-conditioning.</li></ul><p>Prices shown above are for a 3-night stay (Thursday, May 22 - Sunday, May 25) and include a linen rental pack (with pillow, cotton blanket, sheet set, pillowcase, bath towel and washcloth).</p><p>Other Reunions are also in touch with Rider, so we’d like to get our rooms reserved ASAP. If you’re interested, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/3dJqY5w1rwGkmwD19">this google form</a> by THIS SUNDAY, March 9: https://forms.gle/3dJqY5w1rwGkmwD19</p><p><strong>Swag</strong></p><p>Everyone registered for Reunions will receive a t-shirt, and each party will receive a tote bag, enamel pin, and bandana. But we ALSO have some bonus swag in <a href="https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00">our class store</a>! Get belts, extra shirts, umbrellas, hats, and even jacket fabric to make your own accessories (the fabric will be sent to you in time to get things made)…<a href="https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00">get it now</a>!</p><p><strong>Tiger Camp Reminder</strong></p><p>During Reunions, Princeton partners with the YWCA Princeton to offer “Tiger Camp.” It’s a great, safe, fun place for kids from 3 months to 12 years to spend the day (and maybe give you some breathing room). They offer sessions on Friday from 6pm to midnight, and on Saturday from noon to 6pm and then again from 6pm to midnight. Pricing is set by age, and discounts are available for multiple children. Registration has just opened, but it fills up quickly.

The purpose of this message is (1) to provide an update on theme and jacket planning, and (2) to invite you to provide feedback on ideas.</p><p><strong>25th Reunion Costume</strong></p><p>As you may recall from Reunions, the centerpiece of the 25th will be a new Reunions jacket.  This blazer is a more formal upgrade from the beer jacket we received at graduation, and classmates typically continue to wear their 25th blazers at future Reunions and other alumni events.  There will be other pieces to our 25th Reunion look, please stay tuned!</p><p>The blazer will be a separate purchase from your registration fee, and classmates will be given the opportunity to order 25th blazers whether or not they are able to attend the 25th in person.  You’ll hear from us in the fall about ordering and sizing details.</p><p><strong>25th Reunion Theme</strong></p><p>After having our 20th canceled due to COVID, classmate feedback ahead of our 25th is clear: We are hearing that you want “high attendance,” “broad participation,” and “to focus on being together.”  Your Reunions volunteers – more than 30 strong so far – fully agree!</p><p>We have also been told by some of you that the overall feel of our Reunion is more important than the specific theme, and we have heard words like “classic,” “fun,” “classy,” and “good looking jacket.”</p><p>Taking into account theme suggestions from classmates, general concepts informed by previous classes’ 25th experience, and University guidelines for Reunions themes, the relevant committees have met several times to brainstorm and develop workable ideas for our 25th Reunion theme.  And now we are ready to hear from you once again…</p><p><a href="http://url1707.princeton.edu/uni/ls/click?upn=u001.n3nnp8OSNP2-2FHbo-2F-2BocdbK45Md2EorqhbNVmS4IOlKWz2pLVtZDTK5VV5TDxbocgPfmsg7QnymwQp00GECGdX-2B52I6JLSy0hGc63VX5gtvW8BeWXzB6OlA38ek-2FfPnmvNbFhKom95uSCzXRCZhLTZK8oc-2BITfpfS-2FR92HKonARg-3DJjxX_RNtWHZlvBOgdhx1h3dB6K7OWLj-2B8iTpXZeK8qIx1OVVqfkLQhoz-2BRJ5uq6VxyJtYKEQc2KJJ90mTtvf-2B-2FMFemMxUom474kwepPkJAAYfKSsL-2BlIjWBWlnMm9qTzvGHoO5051UM5HL4lg2AENpgir8dENGbSOoFsol3hm0TeQaopruPD-2B9C5YmEJXq6I7wxv-2FEo4Lkb5K2KepzQwm6Q5tSbOo8F7q1X5MuLvp0EMfPcE4ccLi1sfbJqyTuDZz-2BDcSPS2onFuPDOFF9pYy1ii5pyiO9iW6YPCmU9WmrYzov9ekOHtq8DKXWopHfQb5B-2BQndtHUAAj5nCH3K1c0KX-2B0AZDDIKHUZkoebvD0oSCR6awEAVIZ-2FHn4zXrUAD-2FmNexX2YtyRN-2BD9dtPlQSYZFpXzMiSMFSznSMUUl06ojHDjgpDRuUxEPNIA4uwiRLZJNX9-2FsYfKt9y1zz302D-2FwCkSwXzJKa1n3WPvc3KotY-2FuDko-3D">Give us your feedback!</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://reunions.princeton2000.org/letters/25th_housing_book_club</guid><title>25th_housing_book_club</title><link>https://reunions.princeton2000.org/letters/25th_housing_book_club</link><description><![CDATA[Gang – We are less than a month away from the biggest Reunions of All-Time.

As the news of his untimely demise breaks stateside, a group of friends, fixers, hustlers, and opportunists vie to seize control of the narrative: Doe’s chess-master of an agent Nia, ready to call in every favor she is owed to preserve his legacy; down-on-her-luck journalist Katie, who fabricates a story about Doe to save her job at a failing website; and world-famous chef Paolo Cabrini, Doe’s closest friend and confidant, who finds himself entangled with a deranged Belfast hotel worker whose lurid secret might just take them all down.</p><p>Animated by the authors’ knowledge of high-end restaurants and low-end media, <em>The Lemon</em> delivers a raucous examination of our culture with deliciously cutting prose, crackling dialogue, and an unpredictable plot that will keep you riveted to the last page.</p><p><em>“[T]his poised and playful debut novel is a sly satire on foodie culture and the modern hype machine. . . .

Hope you felt it too. Really, this letter is meant to catch you up with what’s going on with your dear Class of 2000 as we gear up for our 25th Reunion, <strong>May 22-25, 2025</strong>. Email has been unreliable, so we’re going old school to make sure you have the most important information now and know how to stay in touch through the year.</p><p>There are three things to remember:</p><p>•	<a href="https://reunions.princeton2000.org">reunions.princeton2000.org</a> is the source of truth</p><p>•	Registration opens <strong>November 1</strong></p><p>•	Please join our WhatsApp broadcast channel <a href="https://bit.ly/P2000Announcements">here:</a></p><p><strong>Reunions Site – <a href="https://reunions.princeton2000.org">reunions.princeton2000.org</a></strong></p><p>The most important thing to remember is <a href="https://reunions.princeton2000.org">reunions.princeton2000.org</a>. That is the source of truth for all Reunions information going forward. The site has information on housing, schedule, kids’ activities, and frequently asked questions. Some things, like the schedule, are still developing, so check for updates throughout the year.</p><p><strong>Registration – November 1</strong></p><p>Our 25th Reunion will be May 22-25, 2025. That is <strong>the most important date on your calendar</strong> going forward. Just make sure you’re in Princeton those days, and everything else will pretty much work out for you. That said, the second-most important date is <strong>November 1, 2024</strong>, when we open registration.</p><p>Anyway, you can <strong>go to <a href="https://reunions.princeton2000.org">reunions.princeton2000.org</a> on November 1</strong>. We’d really appreciate it if you can register early. The more certainty we have around attendance, the more budget we can commit to our entertainment, food, and beverages. You know you’re coming to Reunions (<em>we all know</em> you’re coming to Reunions)…so register early!</p><p><strong>Communications – <a href="https://bit.ly/P2000Announcements">join our WhatsApp</a></strong></p><p>It seems that only about 60% of you are receiving our emails, and it’s a different 60% each time. If you haven’t received our emails, I’m really sorry about that. We’re trying to address it in three ways.</p><p>First, if you set up forwarding to your real email years ago via an @alumni address, that’s a source of a lot of our problems. Best to go to Tigernet and update the directory to reflect your actual email account.</p><p>Second, while emails from Tigernet don’t seem to deliver, emails from a personal account seem to arrive simply fine. I’m happy to send them again to you on the side. Just drop me an email at jpurnell@alumni and I’ll put you on my list.</p><p>Third, we’ve set up a channel on WhatsApp that will be used for official class announcements. It is not a group chat, just a way for us to broadcast out key information. As a side benefit, it will allow us to get information out quickly during Reunions if we need to adjust anything on the fly. Please  visit <a href="https://bit.ly/P2000Announcements">https://bit.ly/P2000Announcements</a> to join.</p><p><strong>Recap</strong></p><p>•	Right now: <a href="https://bit.ly/P2000Announcements">https://bit.ly/P2000Announcements</a>.</p><p>•	<strong>November 1:</strong> Registration: <a href="https://reunions.princeton2000.org">reunions.princeton2000.org</a>.</p><p>•	<strong>May 22-25:</strong> You, Reunions, Princeton.</p><p>Tiger, Tiger Tiger,</p><p>Justin</p><p>P.S. you look great, everybody loves you, and we all simply can’t <em>wait</em> to see you at Reunions.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://reunions.princeton2000.org/letters/early_registration_last_call</guid><title>early_registration_last_call</title><link>https://reunions.princeton2000.org/letters/early_registration_last_call</link><description><![CDATA[Hey gang – Wishing everyone a very Happy New Year!

Congratulations to the ‘99s on an excellent weekend. But as we all know…it was but a prelude. We’re up! Reunions 2025 runs from Thursday, May 22 through Saturday, May 24th. Mark your calendars! We’ll have a steady drumbeat of information starting this summer as we run up to the big date, but one thing I know people are wondering about is housing. We’re getting blocks at most hotels at every price point, but one hotel that doesn’t do blocks for Reunions is the Nassau Inn. If you’re hoping to stay there, the Nassau Inn starts booking for Reunions 2025 on Wednesday, July 10, at 10am Eastern Time. I think the rooms go very very quickly, so be at the ready.</p><p><strong>Reunions Committee Volunteering</strong></p><p>If you got the Reunions bug this weekend and want to make things happen for the class, the door is always open to volunteers.

Our class dues participation rates have been dropping over the last few years so we wanted to take a moment to explain why we collect dues and what exactly these funds go to support. Class dues cycle on a fiscal year basis (i.e., July 1 – June 30) and fund the obligations of the class and are separate from Annual Giving, which supports the University. Each year these expenses include:</p><ul><li><strong>Princeton Alumni Council (ALCO) Dues:</strong> Each class pays dues to the Alumni Council to fund its operations. ALCO is the official connector of the Alumni Community with the University and organizes all the amazing alumni events you’ve attended including Reunions, Alumni Day, and the highly-successful conferences such as She Roars and ¡Adelante Tigres!. In addition, ALCO connects regional associations and supports class operations.</li><li><strong>Technology, Printing and Mailing:</strong> As you might imagine, there are costs associated with maintaining the website and putting together communications to the class. While not substantial, these costs are recurring.</li><li><strong>Class Events and Community Service:</strong> In past years, our class has been able to support class gatherings in various cities and modestly support community service efforts. However, we’d like to be in a financial position to be able to do more on both fronts.</li><li><strong>Class dues are 100% tax deductible!</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Dues Goals:</strong></p><p>Our goal is to raise our dues participation rate and build class funds to support more class gatherings across the globe. We know you’re busy, and to make it easier, we’ve launched a variety of alternative dues payment plans. In addition to a simple one-time payment, we can now set up recurring annual payments, something many have asked for over the years. In addition, you can now set up a five-year advance payment option. Under this new structure, you can pay your dues with a 20% discount for this year and the next four to come so you can cross this action item off your list (at least until our 30th rolls around)! Finally, we’ve set up a one-time “lifetime” dues plan. If you’d like, you can make a one-time payment of…$2,000 and never worry about dues again! So there are now four options for paying your dues this fiscal year:</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.princeton2000.org/memberships">Pay your dues!</a></strong> <em>(requires Tigernet login)</em></p><ul><li><strong>Regular Dues:</strong>  <a href="https://www.princeton2000.org/memberships">$50/classmate</a></li><li><strong>Annual Dues:</strong> <a href="https://www.princeton2000.org/memberships">$50/classmate/year</a></li><li><strong>Five Year Prepayment Regular Dues:</strong> <a href="https://www.princeton2000.org/memberships">$200/classmate</a></li><li><strong>Lifetime Dues:</strong> <a href="https://www.princeton2000.org/memberships">$2,000/classmate</a></li><li><strong>Catchup Dues:</strong> <a href="https://www.princeton2000.org/memberships">$50/classmate</a></li></ul><p>Please consider donating at your earliest convenience and if you are unsure if you have paid your dues last year or this year, just email our treasurer.</p><p><strong>Dues Payers Receive Priority for On-Campus Reunions Housing</strong></p><p>The Reunions committee has been hard at work securing housing both on and off campus for our class. As a thank you to those classmates whose continued participation enables our class to operate, we will be giving classmates who have paid dues for this year and last (FY 2024-2025 and 2023-2024 respectively) priority in the on-campus housing lottery. In years past, on campus housing has been limited and oversubscribed. This year is expected to be the same. Please note: Beds will first be assigned via a lottery among all classmates who meet the dues payment requirement by December 15, 2024. If you have not paid your 2023-2024 dues yet, you will have the opportunity to pay these dues in arrears in order to qualify. Any beds not assigned in this preferential lottery will then be made available in a lottery to the rest of the class.</p><p><strong>For more 25th Reunion Housing details, including 2000 Hotel Blocks, please visit the Housing page</strong></p><p>Finally, our class relies on the updates you send in with your dues! Even just a line or two about a recent move, a new job or baby, or a mini-Reunion with old friends keeps our Class Notes column current and fresh with news from classmates you may not see on Facebook or other social media. All updates submitted either via snail mail or the P2000 website are read! And, of course, you can always email Morey.</p><p>Your ideas are always welcome. We hope to see you all in Tigertown this June for Reunions 2025 (May 22-25)!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://reunions.princeton2000.org/faq/jacket-sizing-tailoring</guid><title>jacket-sizing-tailoring</title><link>https://reunions.princeton2000.org/faq/jacket-sizing-tailoring</link><description><![CDATA[Pro-tip: If you’re thinking about getting your jacket tailored for future Reunions (you’ll get them when you get to Reunions this year), it’s best to pick a size that lines up with your shoulder width, as that’s the hardest thing for a tailor to change.
