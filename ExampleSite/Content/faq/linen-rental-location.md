- If you pre-ordered linens (e.g. sheets, towels, blankets, and pillow) and are staying on-campus, they will be placed in your dorm room in advance of your arrival. When you depart, you will return your linen rentals to the registration table at Whitman College. Please confirm that a crew member marks your items as returned.  

- As a reminder, there will be a $50 charge per set of bed linens that are not properly returned at the conclusion of the event.
