# On-Campus Housing at the 25th

We will have a **limited** allotment of on-campus beds. On-campus beds provide a more affordable housing option than staying at a nearby hotel. However, we want you to understand some important considerations regarding on-campus beds:

 - We cannot guarantee specific rooming assignments, and assignments will not be known until shortly before the event.
 - We will do our best to keep you and your guests together first, followed by requests to be with other members of the Class.
 - Nevertheless, your party may be split across multiple rooms.
 - Linens can be rented at registration. The package is $30 for the weekend, and includes two sheets, a pillow and pillowcase, a blanket, two bth towels, and a washcloth. Alternatively, you can bring pillow/sheets/towels yourself.
 - Beds are purchased during Reunions Registration. If you have already registered for reunions but want to add on-campus housing to your registration, please [reach out to Registration](mailto:princeton2000reunions@gmail.com?subject=[25th%20Reunion]%20On-Campus%20Housing) 

 * Note: You may purchase one (1) on-campus bed for each 3-Day (Full Weekend) Registration package ordered (applies for both adult and child registrations); to clarify, if you are purchasing a Saturday-Only registration ticket (and no 3-Day tickets) you will **not** be eligible to purchase an on-campus bed.  
 - If we run out of on-campus beds, you will have the option to sign up for the wait list; you will be contacted later should beds become available.
 * NOTE: On-site housing accommodations are **dormitory-style rooms** which will require the use of a **shared** bathroom and shower facilities that are not part of the room itself.

 - On-campus bed details: $150 each; Linens can be rented for $30, or you can bring pillow/sheets/towels yourself.
 - On-site housing may be located **anywhere** on the Princeton campus.
 - On-site housing and room assignments will be arranged by the University (**not** by our classmate volunteers).
 - On-site housing and room assignments will **NOT be known** until you check-in on campus at Reunions.
