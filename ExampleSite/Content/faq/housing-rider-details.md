- All rooms, regardless of location, are student housing (ie. they do not come furnished with anything except a bed, dresser, closet, desk, and chair). They do not have trash cans or amenities like bathroom toiletries, etc.

- A 3-night minimum stay is required.

- Suites with 4 beds will have a shared bathroom.

- Linens are included ($25 fee).

- Rider is on the shuttle route again this year. Pickup/drop off is in front of the Moore Library on our campus.

- Check-in will be at Rider from 3-7 pm on Thursday. Afterwards, check-in will be at the 25th check-in at our Whitman Headquarters.
