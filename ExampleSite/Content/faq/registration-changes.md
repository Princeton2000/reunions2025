- **Option A:** Find your original registration email (subject: Reunions 2025 Confirmation). Scroll to the bottom. You should see one button for “View Registration Details” and one for “Update My Registration.” Use the “Update” button to make any changes.

- **Option B:** Navigate to the Reunions registration site and log in with Tigernet. You should be able to update the registration from there.

- **Option C:** If you have tried both of these steps without success, capture a screenshot of the errors and email those to the [Registration Chair](mailto:princeton2000reunions@gmail.com).
