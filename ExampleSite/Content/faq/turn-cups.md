- Did you know that in 2022, it was estimated that Reunions sent more than 320,000 single-use plastic cups to landfills and generated 110 tons of waste? We have partnered with [TURN](https://turnus.in/), a leader in supplying reusable cups systems to use reusable cups at our bars this reunion weekend. Large events like Austin City Limits, Lollapalooza, and the Daytona 500 now use TURN to reduce waste, as well as major corporations like [Starbucks](https://www.packagingdive.com/news/starbucks-turn-reusable-cups-pilot-california/691539/), [Live Nation](https://turnus.in/blogs/as-seen-in/live-nation-to-introduce-reusable-cups-at-venues-and-festivals-a-major-step-toward-zero-waste-concerts), and [Delta Airlines](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/2023/06/01/delta-air-lines-is-trialling-reusable-cups-for-main-cabin-drink-service-in-an-attempt-to-slash-single-use-plastics/).

- Using (appropriately orange) reusable cups dramatically reduces landfill waste, and we encourage you to model great cup re-use and return behavior for the other classes visiting our site. Look for the marked bins and know the planet and future generations thank you.

- PS – If you are missing the old logo cups, know that pre-registered classmates and guests will also receive a branded 25th logo cup to use throughout the weekend and take home with them.
