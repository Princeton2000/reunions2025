- As the 25th Reunion class, we will be near the head of the P-rade, right behind the Old Guard. After we march, the P-rade will continue for hours before the eating club barbecues and other activities commence. 
<!--- We encourage classmates to find a spot along the P-rade route past the “alumni arch” banner or relax inside our HQ area at Whitman College. Note that the class of 2024 will be positioned along the route near Whitman, and the area near the end of the route will be crowded. Alcoholic beverages will not be served at the HQs during the P-rade.-->
