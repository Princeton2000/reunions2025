The Princeton University Events app is now available for download on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crowdcompass.appOgVXiMBaV6) and at the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/princeton-university-events/id1158002447). The Reunions 2025 event will initially require that you enter an email address and case-sensitive last name to unlock. You must use the same email that you used to register through the Reunion IQ site.
