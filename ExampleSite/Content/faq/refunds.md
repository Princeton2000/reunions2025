question: What is the cancellation / refund policy for the Class of 2000â€™s 25th Reunion?

- Non-refundable deposits and fees must be paid over the course of planning our 25th, based upon our registration numbers. We do not have corporate budgets, and our major reunions are entirely funded by classmate registration fees. As such, cancellation terms are as follows:

- Cancellations prior to 1/15/25 will receive a 75% refund;
- Cancellations prior to 3/1/25 will receive a 50% refund;
- After 3/1/25, no refund will be given.
