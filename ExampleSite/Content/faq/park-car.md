Parking is extremely limited, and attendees are strongly encouraged to use hotel shuttles, transit, or carpool when traveling to campus. For more information on shuttle service, accessible parking, and the Reunions Headquarters and Parking map, please visit the [Parking and Transportation page of the Reunions website](https://reunions.princeton.edu/map/).
