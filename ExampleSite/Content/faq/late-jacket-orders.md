question: Will I still be able to order a 25th reunion jacket to wear for future events?

- Yes, you will be able to place a jacket order after Reunions. However, because these jackets will be in a smaller production run, the cost will be higher, which will also provide for shipping.

<!--- If you will not be attending Reunions, email [jacket czar](mailto:p2000jackets@gmail.com) after the planning team has had a chance to recover from the weekend, but before June 5, with the subject line “LATE JACKET ORDER.”-->
