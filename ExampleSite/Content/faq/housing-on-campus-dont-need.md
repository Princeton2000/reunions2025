Please notify [registration](mailto:princeton2000reunions@gmail.com?subject=[25th%20Reunion]%20On-Campus%20Housing) as soon possible. They will check to see who is next on the waitlist queue. If you need to cancel after April 30, 2025, and if there is a taker on the waitlist, you will be refunded your housing fee. If not, we still have to pay Princeton for the bed, and we will not be able to refund the fee.
