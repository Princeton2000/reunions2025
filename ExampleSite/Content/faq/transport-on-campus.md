- **Rovers** — clearly marked, student-driven golf carts that serve as a mini transit connection on the core of campus — will operate throughout Reunions, Thursday through Saturday night.

- Rovers are intended for alumni and guests with personal mobility limitations, the Old Guard, and families with young children.

- Rovers will provide frequent service to the Theater Drive Garage and lot P20, the transit plaza, hotel shuttles, Forbes, and Reunions headquarters sites along Elm Drive and Chapel Drive.

- In addition, the University’s new fleet of **electric shuttles** will loop the perimeter of campus, including the new Stadium Drive Garage and Lot 20 parking at the bottom of campus.

- A map of TigerTransit campus shuttles and Rover routes will be available closer to Reunions on the [Parking and Transportation page of the Reunions website](https://reunions.princeton.edu/map/).

- During Reunions, you will be able to track hotel shuttles and campus shuttles on the [Tiger Tracker mobile website](http://bit.ly/tiger-tracker)."
