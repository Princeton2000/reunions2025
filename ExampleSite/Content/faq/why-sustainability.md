- Like many large festivals, Reunions has a large environmental footprint. For example, alumni travel on average 1,900 miles round trip, which equates to a travel-related carbon footprint of ~7,900 tons of CO2 (comparable to the annual electricity use of 1,500 US homes).

- In addition, Reunions weekend generates a massive amount of landfill waste. The Greening Reunions Alumni Group (GRAWG) estimated that Reunions 2022 sent more than 320,000 single-use plastic cups to landfills and generated 110 tons of waste.

- If [music festivals are developing roadmaps](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/10/style/music-festivals-green-carbon-neutral-eco-friendly.html) to reduce their environmental footprints, and sporting events like the [WM Phoenix Open](https://www.wm.com/us/en/inside-wm/phoenix-open) have gone zero waste; Reunions can make meaningful progress as well! We care about the future of the planet for ourselves and for our tiger cubs, and we want to do our part.

- If youâ€™d like to learn more about the broader alumni efforts to make reunions more sustainable and communicate your support of these initiatives, check out the [Greening Reunions](https://greeningreunions.weebly.com/) site and their [open letter to President Christopher Eisgruber](https://greeningreunions.weebly.com/open-letter.html).
