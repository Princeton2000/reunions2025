Here is a [list of local hotels](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1chWYFV69EQlY-L3wMB8wqE0hravAz8YuFYw_Y0W5qkk/edit?gid=0#gid=0) that have historically been serviced by Reunions Shuttles.

Limited on-campus housing will be allocated via lottery in mid-February. Those who receive beds will be emailed, and room assignments will be distributed by University housing representatives at check-in.

For those who indicate interest in on-campus housing but do not receive beds, an email will also be sent in mid-February offering alternative housing options (the class is investigating housing at Rider College for these classmates and their guests).
