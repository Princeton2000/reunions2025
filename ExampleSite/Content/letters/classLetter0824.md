Dear Classmate,

Yes!

Sorry, I had to try that out…what a thrill! Hope you felt it too. Really, this letter is meant to catch you up with what’s going on with your dear Class of 2000 as we gear up for our 25th Reunion, **May 22-25, 2025**. Email has been unreliable, so we’re going old school to make sure you have the most important information now and know how to stay in touch through the year.

There are three things to remember:

•	[reunions.princeton2000.org](https://reunions.princeton2000.org) is the source of truth

•	Registration opens **November 1**

•	Please join our WhatsApp broadcast channel [here:](https://bit.ly/P2000Announcements)

**Reunions Site – [reunions.princeton2000.org](https://reunions.princeton2000.org)**

The most important thing to remember is [reunions.princeton2000.org](https://reunions.princeton2000.org). That is the source of truth for all Reunions information going forward. The site has information on housing, schedule, kids’ activities, and frequently asked questions. Some things, like the schedule, are still developing, so check for updates throughout the year.

**Registration – November 1**

Our 25th Reunion will be May 22-25, 2025. That is **the most important date on your calendar** going forward. Just make sure you’re in Princeton those days, and everything else will pretty much work out for you. That said, the second-most important date is **November 1, 2024**, when we open registration.

Anyway, you can **go to [reunions.princeton2000.org](https://reunions.princeton2000.org) on November 1**. We’d really appreciate it if you can register early. The more certainty we have around attendance, the more budget we can commit to our entertainment, food, and beverages. You know you’re coming to Reunions (*we all know* you’re coming to Reunions)…so register early!

**Communications – [join our WhatsApp](https://bit.ly/P2000Announcements)**

It seems that only about 60% of you are receiving our emails, and it’s a different 60% each time. If you haven’t received our emails, I’m really sorry about that. We’re trying to address it in three ways.

First, if you set up forwarding to your real email years ago via an @alumni address, that’s a source of a lot of our problems. Best to go to Tigernet and update the directory to reflect your actual email account.

Second, while emails from Tigernet don’t seem to deliver, emails from a personal account seem to arrive simply fine. I’m happy to send them again to you on the side. Just drop me an email at jpurnell@alumni and I’ll put you on my list. 

Third, we’ve set up a channel on WhatsApp that will be used for official class announcements. It is not a group chat, just a way for us to broadcast out key information. As a side benefit, it will allow us to get information out quickly during Reunions if we need to adjust anything on the fly. Please  visit [https://bit.ly/P2000Announcements](https://bit.ly/P2000Announcements) to join.
