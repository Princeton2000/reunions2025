**Reunions 2024 – History!**

Reunions 2024…in a books and a major success! Congratulations to the ‘99s on an excellent weekend. But as we all know…it was but a prelude. We’re up! Reunions 2025 runs from Thursday, May 22 through Saturday, May 24th. Mark your calendars! We’ll have a steady drumbeat of information starting this summer as we run up to the big date, but one thing I know people are wondering about is housing. We’re getting blocks at most hotels at every price point, but one hotel that doesn’t do blocks for Reunions is the Nassau Inn. If you’re hoping to stay there, the Nassau Inn starts booking for Reunions 2025 on Wednesday, July 10, at 10am Eastern Time. I think the rooms go very very quickly, so be at the ready.
