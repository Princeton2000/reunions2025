Every Princetonian learns about the University’s commitment to service, but for Juan Goytia and others from the Class of 2000, that mission was imprinted in a profound way. They were first-year students when Princeton marked its 250th anniversary in October 1996, a celebration that featured luminaries and a redefining of the University’s unofficial motto.

“Toni Morrison spoke and [former Princeton president] Harold Shapiro came up with ‘In the nation’s service and in the service of all nations,” Goytia said. “You could feel that spirit across campus: We’re so blessed and fortunate to be at Princeton, yes, but what are we going to do with our Princeton educations to make things better, to create value in whatever profession we choose? This focus on service really stuck with me.”
