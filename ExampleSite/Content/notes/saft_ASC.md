Brad Saft ’00 recalls his unusual experience when he was interviewed as a prospective student in 1995. The alumnus asked him a number of “unrelated, difficult trivia-based questions” that left him feeling deflated. Saft vowed that if he ever had the “good fortune” to graduate from Princeton and become an interviewer, he would approach the interview process very differently. As the chair of the Princeton Schools Committee for the last two years, he has been able to do just that.

In collaboration with the Admission Office, he has led the effort in creating a “Positively Princeton” experience for interviewing prospective students, which, this year, reached record numbers of applicants.

“‘Positively Princeton’ is a different way of thinking about alumni interviewing,” Saft explained. “It’s seeing our role as ambassadors and reporters rather than as evaluators. And it is recognizing that the experience, for both of our constituencies — the applicants and the volunteers, needs to be a great one.”
