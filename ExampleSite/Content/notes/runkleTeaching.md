Ben Runkle, associate professor of biological and agricultural engineering at the U of A, has been named the recipient of the American Geophysical Union's 2024 Sulzman Award for Scientific Excellence Through Education and Mentoring.  

The American Geophysical Union, the world's largest Earth and space science association, celebrates individuals and teams through its annual Honors and Recognition program for their research, education, science communication and outreach accomplishments. These honorees have transformed our understanding of the world, impacted our everyday lives, improved our communities and contributed to solutions for a sustainable future.

The association's Sulzman Award for Scientific Excellence Through Education and Mentoring is presented annually to an early- to mid-career scientist in recognition of significant contributions as a role model and mentor for the next generation of biogeoscientists, especially those underrepresented in Earth sciences.

One of Runkle's collaborators, Angelia Seyfferth, who has worked with him over the last seven years, shared the impact he has had on her career.

"Ben's collaborative nature has opened doors for me. â€¦ Ben truly cares about his students and his colleagues and has an aura of positivity around him. He creates a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone and allows people to grow to be their best selves," said Seyfferth, a soil scientist and associate dean at the University of Delaware.

When asked what it means to receive this award, Runkle said, "I can genuinely say that this is a meaningful recognition; I am proud of the diverse pathways my advisees have taken through science and their careers."

Runkle joins a distinguished group of scientists, leaders and communicators recognized by the association for advancing science. Each honoree reflects the association's vision for a thriving, sustainable and equitable future supported by scientific discovery, innovation and action.

Honorees will be recognized at AGU24, which will convene more than 25,000 attendees from over 100 countries in Washington, D.C., and online Dec. 9-13. Reflecting the theme "What's Next for Science" at AGU24, the Honors Reception will recognize groundbreaking achievements that illustrate science's continual advancement, inspiring the association's community with their stories and successes.
