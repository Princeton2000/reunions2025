Princeton University announced on Wednesday that John Mack ’00, a former captain of the men’s track and field team, will be the next Ford Family Director of Athletics. He will officially begin his tenure on Sept. 1.

Mack’s time as a sprinter on the men’s track and field team was marked by success. He is a four-time winner of the 400 meter title at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships (Heps), with three wins from indoor seasons and one from outdoors. His relay wins include the 4x400 at the 1997 and 1999 Indoor Heps. After serving as team captain, Mack was awarded the Bonthron Trophy in 2000. The Bonthron Trophy is one of the team’s highest awards, given to a member of the team “who through sportsmanship, influence and performance has contributed most to the sport at Princeton.”
