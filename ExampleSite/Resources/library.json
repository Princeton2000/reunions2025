But over the following two decades as a TV reporter and creator of CNBC’s Disruptor 50 franchise, interviewing, and studying thousands of executives, she realized that a gender-equity utopia shouldn’t be a pipe dream. Yes, women faced massive social and institutional headwinds, and struggled with double standards and what psychologists call “pattern matching.” Yet those who thrived, Boorstin found, shared key commonalities that made them uniquely equipped to lead, grow businesses, and navigate crises. They were highly adaptive to change, deeply empathetic in their management style, and much more likely to integrate diverse points of view into their business strategies, filling voids that their male counterparts had overlooked for generations. By utilizing those strengths, they had invented new business models, disrupted industries, and made massive profits along the way.\n  \n  Now, in When Women Lead, Boorstin brings together the stories of over sixty of those female CEOs and leaders, and dozens of new studies. Her combination of narrative and research reveals how once-underestimated characteristics, from vulnerability and gratitude to divergent thinking, can be vital superpowers—and that anyone can work these approaches to their advantage. Featuring new interviews with Katrina Lake, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jenn Hyman, Whitney Wolfe Herd, Lena Waithe, Shivani Siroya, Julia Collins, and more, When Women Lead is a radical blueprint for the future of business, and our world at large.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": "https://www.booksamillion.com/p/9781982168216"},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": "https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7567305-11819508?SID=simonsayscom&url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9781982168216"},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1982168218?tag=simonsayscom"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": "https://books.apple.com/us/book/when-women-lead/id1609263967"},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/1688/9781982168216"},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

They are when it's the late Frank Biondi, the former CEO of HBO, Universal Studios, and Viacom, who leaves a legacy far beyond the movies and TV you love. Through Frank's example, we can learn how to make good relationships alongside great deals, earn respect while earning multi-million dollar returns, and maintain character even when surrounded by an industry full of characters.\n\nLet's Be Frank began in the final years of Frank Biondi's life as he recorded the story of his career while fighting stage-four cancer, a battle he sadly lost in 2019. His daughter, Jane Biondi Munna, compiled his words-along with recollections from media industry luminaries Peter Chernin, Tom Freston, Alan Horn, Sherry Lansing, Alan Schwartz, and more -so that we can all draw inspiration from Frank Biondi's remarkable business acumen and management style and channel our inner Frank as we navigate life's challenges and opportunities.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": "https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Lets-Be-Frank/Frank-Biondi/9781632995797?id=9240744276881"},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/lets-be-frank-frank-biondi/1142247453?ean=9781632995797"},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Lets-Be-Frank-Daughters-Tribute/dp/1632995794/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.09z_fGQUmJRIrQw9rsZ5fw.yxheIVGClQLDGGqTrpZR0V7IMc1sJp9vTFpLgYq9jP0&qid=1725411118&sr=8-1"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": "https://books.apple.com/us/book/lets-be-frank/id6443591733"},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/p/books/let-s-be-frank-a-daughter-s-tribute-to-her-father-the-media-mogul-you-ve-never-heard-of/18905298?ean=9781632995797"},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

Flying cars that can land like helicopters, artificial intelligence-powered drones that can fly into buildings and map their interiors, microsatellites that can see through clouds and monitor rogue missile sites—all these and more are becoming part of America’s DIU-fast-tracked arsenal.\n\nUntil recently, the Pentagon was known for its uncomfortable relationship with Silicon Valley and for slow-moving processes that acted as a brake on innovation. Unit X was specifically designed as a bridge to Valley technologists that would accelerate bringing state of the art software and hardware to the battle space. Given authority to cut through red tape and function almost as a venture capital firm, Shah, Kirchhoff, and others in the Unit who came after were tasked particularly with meeting immediate military needs with technology from Valley startups rather than from so-called “primes”—behemoth companies like Lockheed, Raytheon, and Boeing.\n\nTaking us inside AI labs, drone workshops, and battle command centers—and, also, overseas to Ukraine’s frontlines—Shah and Kirchhoff paint a fascinating picture of what it takes to stay dominant in a fast-changing and often precarious geopolitical landscape.\n\nIn an era when America’s chief rival, China, has ordered that all commercial firms within its borders make their research and technology available for military exploitation, strengthening the relationship between Washington and Silicon Valley was always advisable. Today, it is an urgent necessity.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": "https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Unit-X/Raj-M-Shah/9781668031384?id=9240744276881"},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/unit-x-raj-m-shah/1144226657?ean=9781668031384"},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Unit-Pentagon-Silicon-Valley-Transforming/dp/1668031388/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2KEXWJVKS3RX2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.tHgFpmCgsCsgqH8EuaqUOg.XQBOeaiMmkpd8B_jcw1mrpZ2Os7xazC5nJCnEIjFbQQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=Unit+X%3A+How+the+Pentagon+and+Silicon+Valley+Are+Transforming+the+Future+of+War&qid=1725411244&sprefix=unit+x+how+the+pentagon+and+silicon+valley+are+transforming+the+future+of+war%2Caps%2C107&sr=8-1"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": "https://books.apple.com/us/book/unit-x/id6469519501"},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/book/9781668031384"},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

How is a small-town art teacher supposed to cope without the never-ending life advice and enjoyment that books give her?

Competition in the Promised Land provides a comprehensive account of the long-lasting effects of the influx of black workers on labor markets and urban space in receiving areas.\n\nTraditionally, the Great Black Migration has been lauded as a path to general black economic progress. Leah Boustan challenges this view, arguing instead that the migration produced winners and losers within the black community. Boustan shows that migrants themselves gained tremendously, more than doubling their earnings by moving North. But these new arrivals competed with existing black workers, limiting black–white wage convergence in Northern labor markets and slowing black economic growth. Furthermore, many white households responded to the black migration by relocating to the suburbs. White flight was motivated not only by neighborhood racial change but also by the desire on the part of white residents to avoid participating in the local public services and fiscal obligations of increasingly diverse cities.\n\nEmploying historical census data and state-of-the-art econometric methods, Competition in the Promised Land revises our understanding of the Great Black Migration and its role in the transformation of American society.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": "https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Competition-Promised-Land/Leah-Platt-Boustan/9780691202495?id=9240744276881"},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/competition-in-the-promised-land-leah-platt-boustan/1123687837?ean=9780691202495"},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Competition-Promised-Land-Migrants-Publications/dp/0691202494/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1QKX7D7PWLZPA&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.uzb8uhRAwpkJOY5xysxZCQ.1oF7yaRza7AUq4Y2oUt8HATw4kKTs_V24_G1VgCC8Gw&dib_tag=se&keywords=Competition+in+the+Promised+Land%3A+Black+Migrants+in+Northern+Cities+and+Labor+Markets&qid=1725411696&sprefix=competition+in+the+promised+land+black+migrants+in+northern+cities+and+labor+markets%2Caps%2C76&sr=8-1"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": "https://books.apple.com/us/book/competition-in-the-promised-land/id1111355748"},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/book/9780691202495"},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

The accumulation of human capital—the knowledge and skill of workers—has featured prominently in American economic leadership over the past two centuries.\n  \nHuman Capital in History brings together contributions from leading researchers in economic history, labor economics, the economics of education, and related fields. Building on Claudia Goldin’s landmark research on the labor history of the United States, the authors consider the roles of education and technology in contributing to American economic growth and well-being, the experience of women in the workforce, and how trends in marriage and family affected broader economic outcomes.

Together with producer Tim Sonnefeld, she created the sound for Leap, mixing her well-seasoned band with vintage programming sounds and a bit of an otherworldly quality to match the rich, angelic tone of IVA’s deep-digging vocals.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": null},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon", "url": null},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": null},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": null},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": "https://music.apple.com/us/album/leap-ep/1007478585"},{"source": "Spotify", "url": "https://open.spotify.com/album/45SRfXVS78GjJ6Nrmjd35p"},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": "https://amazon.com/music/player/albums/B00ZGLEO82?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_9IYKL4nRAHVwGKUWWAco1YUjW"},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

He is a beautiful human and ingenious at playing just what is needed on multiple instruments. After lockdown, it felt like family to coming together with the full band and recording songs we’d been playing live before Covid took us all inside. Ross was keenly sensitive and had gentle command of the sound and musicians. There was a feeling of trust and love among all who worked on the album. Engineer Doug Raus is also a dream to have in the studio and, among other feats, found the perfect vocal sound, and the three of us, along with my doggie Moxie, had many happy hours in the studio working on Nobody’s Woman.”\nThe EP kicks off with the Aimee Mann flavored “Mid Air” and features IVA’s passionate, plaintive vocals. “The writing of these songs came out of some lovely invitations to Nashville,” says IVA. “I’d worked with Kim Richey at the Banff music center, and she invited me to write with her and Bill Demain. I went into the session with “I feel poor in the morning, rich at night” and the song unfolded. I was amazed at how they tapped into a way I was feeling that I hadn’t yet put my finger on.”\nNext up is the most Americana-inspired song of the quartet, title track “Nobody’s Woman,” opening with IVA’s vocal and an acoustic guitar, lamenting “now I’m nobody’s woman and you’re everyone’s man.” As the song unfolds, Jaron Olevsky’s (Amos Lee) atmospheric Hammond organ gives the song a needed reverence. “A beloved partner and I had broken up due to substance abuse and I was feeling quite raw about it,” says the songstress. “Of all the songs, this is the one I’m most proud of. I wrote it at my spinet piano at a little farmhouse in Delaware as I wept … and owned up to myself.”\n“Oh Christian” was written in collaboration with Thom Donovan (Will Hogue) and adopts a Dap Kings-esque horn section and driving beat. “I wanted a rollicking big band sound” says IVA. “The band dove into this one and it took on a full life, especially with Matt Scarano’s drums and Sam Nobels’ bass. I was dancing around the studio, and we had so many laughs. For the vox, with Ross and Doug there, I could lean into the song and got wild at the end. I remember Ross saying at the end of a take, ‘And now, dismount’ as if I’d been riding a stallion.”\nThe EP’s final track, “Heart,” has an early rock and roll vibe, a Jerry Lee Lewis rhythm, and was written about the vocalist’s childhood friend who passed away suddenly. “Eric and I were on swim team when we were kids, and he had a condition that made it hard for him to move naturally” she explains. “Yet I remembered how happy he was, his eyes shining, and how brave he was every time he got in the pool to compete. He always finished the race and did his best. During the pandemic I played the song for his family and they asked for a recording of the song, which moved the needle on us going back into the studio. Fortunately, they were touched and considered the song a real tribute to their son.”\n“Working with IVA on her music was a real joy,” raves producer Bellinoit. “I’ve never felt more trusted as a producer to be a caretaker for someone’s songs. On the same token, her north star as an artist always kept us in check if things were getting off the mark (which frankly, very rarely happened).”\n“When we first got together to make some acoustic demos of some of the songs, I remember feeling how strong they were on their own simply with a guitar and voice,” he continues. “When you’re building a house, the foundation needs to be so incredibly solid that it can withstand any direction you want to decorate it in. When we started working together, the key word that kept coming up was retro. I wanted these songs to sound timeless, and at the same time, have her voice act as the thread that brought it into the future.”\nIVA is a vocalist and songwriter with an ethereal quality to her powerful voice and a cinematic feel to her music. Her work is transporting, taking the listener into a world of inspired imagery that evokes deep feelings of peace, inspiration, and longing. Early on she signed her original music with Universal Sweden, performing on national TV and radio while making her debut at the Swedish Royal Opera. Now IVA is the youngest laureate of the Vasa Order’s Swedish American of the Year award.\nShe’s been tapped “Who’s Next” by M Musicians Magazine, “supremely talented” by Guitar World’s Acoustic Nation, and featured in Billboard. She’s releasing her new record “Nobody’s Woman” this year after making a breakthrough with “Run” on Spotify and AAA radio. She lives between Brooklyn and outside of Philadelphia, where she leads her band.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": null},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon", "url": null},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": null},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": null},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": "https://music.apple.com/us/album/nobodys-woman-ep/1670678792"},{"source": "Spotify", "url": "https://open.spotify.com/album/4YTMkzrjNEPXvMWr7sGmSn"},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": "https://amazon.com/music/player/albums/B0BV7DCCPG?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_iHdgY6Tyda0UHf0PkvFREtqYV"},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

Now, the uncanny parallels between the interwar era and our own—rising inequality, censorship, and challenges to traditional social hierarchies—make his writing even more of the moment. Invocations of Orwell and his classic dystopian novel 1984 have reached new heights, with both sides of the political spectrum embracing the rhetoric of Orwellianism.\n\nIn Orwell’s Ghosts, historian Laura Beers considers Orwell’s full body of work—his six novels, three nonfiction works, and brilliant essays on politics, language, and the class system—to examine what “Orwellian” truly means and reveal the misconstrued thinker in all his complexity. She explores how Orwell’s writing on free speech addresses the proliferation of “fake news” and the emergence of cancel culture, highlights his vivid critiques of capitalism and the oppressive nature of the British Empire, and, in contrast, analyzes his failure to understand feminism.\n\nTimely, wide-ranging, and thought-provoking, Orwell’s Ghosts investigates how the writings of a lionized champion of truth and freedom can help us face the crises of modernity.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": "https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Orwells-Ghosts/Laura-Beers/9781324075080?id=9240744276881"},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/orwells-ghosts-laura-beers/1144065586?ean=9781324075080"},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Orwells-Ghosts-Warnings-Twenty-First-Century/dp/1324075082/ref=sr_1_1?crid=18HPIW8OI55KB&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nixmL3dJvGbGjEi5KS_jZzPKeVARi2fpAWUikBP5gKM.WS0r_kQcNRLcdHnpm0yjFLEqalogjRB7HQdm67-eE0E&dib_tag=se&keywords=Orwell%27s+Ghosts%3A+Wisdom+and+Warnings+for+the+Twenty-First+Century&qid=1725411901&sprefix=orwell%27s+ghosts+wisdom+and+warnings+for+the+twenty-first+century%2Caps%2C103&sr=8-1"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": "https://books.apple.com/us/book/orwells-ghosts-wisdom-and-warnings-for-the-twenty/id6467144351"},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/book/9781324075080"},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

With her parents at constant odds, Song learns more words in Korean for hatred than for love. When the family’s fake Gucci business lands them in bankruptcy, Song moves to a new elementary school. On her first day, a girl asks the teacher: “Can she speak English?”\n\nNeither rich nor white, Song does what is necessary to be visible: she internalizes the model minority myth as well as her beloved mother’s dreams to see her on a secure path. Song meets these expectations by attending the best Ivy League universities in the country. But when she wavers, in search of an artistic life on her own terms, her mother warns, “Happiness is what unexceptional people tell themselves when they don’t have the talent and drive to go after real success.” Years of self-erasure take a toll and Song experiences recurring episodes of depression and mania. A thought repeats: I want to die. I want to die. Song enters a psychiatric hospital where she meets patients with similar struggles. So begins her sweeping journey to heal herself by losing everything.\n\nUnflinching and lyrical, Docile is one woman’s story of subverting the model minority myth, contending with mental illness, and finding her self-worth by looking within.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": "https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Docile/Hyeseung-Song/9781668003664?id=9240744276881"},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/docile-hyeseung-song/1144226598?ean=9781668003664"},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Docile-Memoirs-Not-So-Perfect-Asian-Girl/dp/166800366X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=CDTHQ4TJ5T2B&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.EfbE1PsVWNd3gFllTp-Kyg.od1db_sEJ672sV3OwVo6KgsRidhIwv4wuufiXkTElCk&dib_tag=se&keywords=Docile%3A+Memoirs+of+a+Not-So-Perfect+Asian+Girl&qid=1725411994&sprefix=docile+memoirs+of+a+not-so-perfect+asian+girl%2Caps%2C180&sr=8-1"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": "https://books.apple.com/us/book/docile/id6469520770"},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/book/9781668003664"},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

Now he finally faces trials for his lies, cons, and misdeeds—but many fear Trump will never face any real consequences.\n\nIs our system so broken that some people are now above the law?\n\nIn Taking Down Trump, Tristan Snell—a former assistant attorney general for New York State who took on and beat Trump in a court of law—argues that Donald Trump can indeed be defeated, and shares his secrets for how to beat him.\n\nSnell led New York State’s prosecution of Donald Trump for defrauding hundreds of Trump University students, resulting in Trump having to shell out $25 million to his victims —Trump’s first and only major legal loss to date.\n\nSnell lays out 12 key rules for how to beat Trump—including:\n\nHow voters and activists hold prosecutors accountable\nHow to stand up to Trump’s public bullying\nHow to persevere against all the stonewalling and counterattacks\nHow to get key figures to cooperate and cough up critical evidence\n\nAlong the way, Snell discusses his own experience prosecuting Trump, and observes how prosecutors in the various cases against Trump are exploiting such rules—or not—as well as how Trump’s revolving team of lawyers can be expected to behave, or, more accurately, perform.\n\nWhether you’re a concerned citizen, a lawyer or prosecutor, or an activist or advocate, Snell shows how America’s systems can still work to bring even the richest and most powerful to justice, and why those systems are worth preserving and improving.

While increasing numbers of people rely primarily or exclusively on online platforms, authoritarian regimes have concurrently developed a formidable array of technological capabilities to constrain and repress their citizens.\n\nIn The Rise of Digital Repression, Steven Feldstein documents how the emergence of advanced digital tools bring new dimensions to political repression. Presenting new field research from Thailand, the Philippines, and Ethiopia, he investigates the goals, motivations, and drivers of these digital tactics. Feldstein further highlights how governments pursue digital strategies based on a range of factors: ongoing levels of repression, political leadership, state capacity, and technological development. The international community, he argues, is already seeing glimpses of what the frontiers of repression look like. For instance, Chinese authorities have brought together mass surveillance, censorship, DNA collection, and artificial intelligence to enforce their directives in Xinjiang. As many of these trends go global, Feldstein shows how this has major implications for democracies and civil society activists around the world.\n\nA compelling synthesis of how anti-democratic leaders harness powerful technology to advance their political objectives, The Rise of Digital Repression concludes by laying out innovative ideas and strategies for civil society and opposition movements to respond to the digital autocratic wave.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": "https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Rise-Digital-Repression/Steven-Feldstein/9780190057497?id=9240744276881"},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-rise-of-digital-repression-steven-feldstein/1138125249?ean=9780190057497"},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Digital-Repression-Technology-Resistance/dp/0190057491/ref=sr_1_1?crid=395NYJ0CG62DY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kMs2aDD79GymF0CYY8yPXg.s3WmzURStZwRSE6OvQAnrXswIZSXKSVMOC0ke6-N8CY&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Rise+of+Digital+Repression%3A+How+Technology+is+Reshaping+Power%2C+Politics%2C+and+Resistance&qid=1725412300&sprefix=the+rise+of+digital+repression+how+technology+is+reshaping+power%2C+politics%2C+and+resistance%2Caps%2C120&sr=8-1"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": "https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-rise-of-digital-repression/id1573336790"},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": null},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

Quitting his job, he embarks on a vigilante mission to take down the animal-trafficking syndicate from the inside. Meanwhile, in Florida, insurance investigator Randall Knight is called to a private roadside zoo, where a new tiger cub of suspect lineage brought a virus that wiped out all the zoo’s tigers. The disease is just one species jump away from erupting into a deadly global human pandemic. What starts as a simple insurance claim leads Knight to discover a shocking new evolution in the business of illicit animal trafficking. Both men’s journeys take them from the darkest corners of Southeast Asia to the VIP gambling rooms of Macau, where they must stay alive long enough to stop a vicious international triad from ending wildlife as we know it.\n\nAnimals is set in the world of global animal trafficking and follows converging story lines into a dark maze of corruption and organized crime, and through the journeys of the main characters, the novel explores the factors driving the exploitation and ruin of the natural world.\n\nThough the story is fiction, the characters, locations, and plot points are almost entirely rooted in fact. They are the product of hundreds of conversations with everyone from Jane Goodall to the CIA, to Damien Mander (an ex-mercenary turned animal activist). To experience the issue firsthand, Will Staples took a month-long research trip spanning three continents and seven countries. The journey was a profoundly transformative, life-altering experience.\n\nThe author’s goal with this novel is to expose this issue to as many people as possible. To that end, all his income from this book will be donated to nonprofit organizations dedicated to protecting wildlife.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": "https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Animals/Will-Staples/9781094065885?id=9240744276881"},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/animals-will-staples/1137516815?ean=9798200834235"},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Animals-Will-Staples-ebook/dp/B0BYTPRQM2?ref_=ast_author_dp"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": "https://books.apple.com/us/book/animals/id1535426971"},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/book/9798200834235"},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

After graduating from Princeton, he moved back to the world which his immigrant parents had abandoned, to a city built between a river and a swamp, where the moisture-drenched air swarms with mosquitos after sundown.\n\nOnce the capital of the British Raj, and then India's industrial and cultural hub, by 2001 Calcutta was clearly past its prime. Why, his relatives beseeched him, had he returned? Surely, he could have moved to Delhi, Bombay or Bangalore, where a new Golden Age of consumption was being born.\n\nYet fifteen million people still lived in Calcutta. Working for the Statesman, its leading English newspaper, Kushanava Choudhury found the streets of his childhood unchanged by time. Shouting hawkers still overran the footpaths, fish-sellers squatted on bazaar floors; politics still meant barricades and bus burnings, while Communist ministers travelled in motorcades.\n\nSifting through the chaos for the stories that never make the papers, Kushanava Choudhury paints a soulful, compelling portrait of the everyday lives that make Calcutta.

Only a generation ago, female adolescence as we know it in the West did not exist in the Middle East. There were only children and married women. Today, young Arab women outnumber men in universities, and a few are beginning to face down religious and social tradition in order to live independently, to delay marriage, and to pursue professional goals. Hundreds of thousands of devout girls and women are attending Qur’anic schools—and using the training to argue for greater rights and freedoms from an Islamic perspective. And, in 2011, young women helped to lead antigovernment protests in the Arab Spring. But their voices have not been heard. Their stories have not been told.\n\nIn Syria, before its civil war, she documents a complex society in the midst of soul searching about its place in the world and about the role of women. In Lebanon, she documents a country that on the surface is freer than other Arab nations but whose women must balance extreme standards of self-presentation with Islamic codes of virtue. In Abu Dhabi, Zoepf reports on a generation of Arab women who’ve found freedom in work outside the home. In Saudi Arabia she chronicles driving protests and women entering the retail industry for the first time. In the aftermath of Tahrir Square, she examines the crucial role of women in Egypt's popular uprising.\n \nDeeply informed, heartfelt, and urgent, Excellent Daughters brings us a new understanding of the changing Arab societies—from 9/11 to Tahrir Square to the rise of ISIS—and gives voice to the remarkable women at the forefront of this change.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": "https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Excellent-Daughters/Katherine-Zoepf/9780143109945?id=9240744276881"},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/excellent-daughters-katherine-zoepf/1122403798?ean=9780143109945"},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Excellent-Daughters-Secret-Lives-Transforming/dp/0143109944/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1N4Q531SQF73I&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.xpHkBm9UaL4g_b8IrauATWwSWBiwSLGBOdfeI-YP4GXGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.ToUkZlzx5UQ1EjmLBXRndKJ151FO5ZB_7t2AfP4v6w8&dib_tag=se&keywords=katherine+zoepf&qid=1725412757&sprefix=katherine+zoepf%2Caps%2C128&sr=8-1"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": "https://books.apple.com/us/book/excellent-daughters/id987303016"},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/book/9780143109945"},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

Eve Babitz was the ultimate factory girl, a pure product of LA.\n\nThe goddaughter of Igor Stravinsky and a graduate of Hollywood High, Babitz, age twenty, posed for a photograph with French artist Marcel Duchamp in 1963. They were seated at a chess board, deep in a game. She was naked; he was not. The picture, cheesecake with a Dadaist twist, made her an instant icon of art and sex. She spent the rest of the decade on the Sunset Strip, rocking and rolling, and honing her notoriety. There were the album covers she designed: for Buffalo Springfield and the Byrds, to name but a few. There were the men she seduced: Jim Morrison, Ed Ruscha, Harrison Ford, to name but a very few.\n\nThen, at nearly thirty, her It girl days numbered, Babitz was discovered—as a writer—by Joan Didion. She would go on to produce seven books, usually billed as novels or short story collections, always autobiographies and confessionals. Her prose achieved that American ideal: art that stayed loose, maintained its cool; art so sheerly enjoyable as to be mistaken for simple entertainment. Yet somehow the world wasn’t paying attention. Babitz languished.\n\nIt was almost twenty years after her last book was published, and only a few years before her death in 2021 that Babitz became a literary star, recognized as not just an essential L.A. writer, but the essential. This late-blooming vogue bloomed, in large part, because of a magazine profile by Lili Anolik, who, in 2010, began obsessively pursuing Babitz, a recluse since burning herself up in a fire in the 90s.\n\nAnolik’s elegant and provocative book is equal parts biography and detective story. It is also on dangerously intimate terms with its subject: artist, writer, muse, and one-woman zeitgeist, Eve Babitz.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": "https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Hollywoods-Eve/Lili-Anolik/9781501125799?id=7460206296950"},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/hollywoods-eve-lili-anolik/1128555083#/"},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Hollywoods-Eve-Babitz-History-L/dp/1501125796/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1532703080&sr=8-1&keywords=lili+anolik"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": "https://books.apple.com/us/book/hollywoods-eve/id1375909955"},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/1688/9781501125799"},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

Found in the wrack, ruin, and filth of her apartment, a stack of boxes packed by her mother decades before. The boxes were pristine, the seals of duct tape unbroken. Inside, a lost world. This world turned for a certain number of years in the late sixties and early seventies, and centered on a two-story rental in a down-at-heel section of Hollywood. 7406 Franklin Avenue, a combination salon-hotbed-living end where writers and artists mixed with movie stars, rock ’n’ rollers, and drug trash.\n\n7406 Franklin Avenue was the making of one great American writer: Joan Didion, a mystery behind her dark glasses and cool expression; an enigma inside her storied marriage to John Gregory Dunne, their union as tortured as it was enduring. 7406 Franklin Avenue was the breaking and then the remaking—and thus the true making—of another great American writer: Eve Babitz, goddaughter of Igor Stravinsky, nude of Marcel Duchamp, consort of Jim Morrison (among many, many others), a woman who burned so hot she finally almost burned herself alive. Didion and Babitz formed a complicated alliance, a friendship that went bad, amity turning to enmity.\n\nDidion, in spite of her confessional style, is so little known or understood. She’s remained opaque, elusive. Until now.\n\nWith deftness and skill, journalist Lili Anolik uses Babitz, Babitz’s brilliance of observation, Babitz’s incisive intelligence, and, most of all, Babitz’s diary-like letters—letters found in those sealed boxes, letters so intimate you don’t read them so much as breathe them—as the key to unlocking Didion.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": "https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Didion-Babitz/Lili-Anolik/9781668065488?id=9174145898094"},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/didion-and-babitz-lili-anolik/1144787481"},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Didion-Babitz-Lili-Anolik/dp/1668065487/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7McA8iUbY2R8gEzgN2mssLqi00-QPpVPY87j1ur7q_Je8RbKpGJMC_-YrCtxFfebECZ6au39PIUuNCj7Jx24nZl2FvmiZg9-Sqj1h1So1TcODWjFz-1DxR9a-UoBr5lbz-laL7PZPJQuH6xxCKA8BSvoq2gJ9zzIPxifxgY71Ho.n-gpYZ7zNRjKfBZ0sFg5RMGkYSLYKA5xFiPcRKPhdPk&qid=1717414464&sr=8-1"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": "https://books.apple.com/us/book/didion-and-babitz/id6477405702"},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/a/1688/9781668065488"},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

The competition for training fellowship spots is intense. Hundreds of applicants from all over the world compete to be accepted into the Cardiovascular Disease Training Fellowship at Johns Hopkins. Only nine are chosen each year. This is the story of one of those fellows.\n\nIn Alpha Docs, Daniel Muñoz, M.D., recounts his transformation from wide-eyed young medical student to caring, empathetic professional—providing a rare inside look into the day-to-day operations of one of the world’s most prestigious medical institutions. The training is arduous and often unforgiving, as Muñoz and his colleagues are schooled by a staff of brilliant and demanding physicians. How they learn the art and science of untangling cardiac mysteries, how they live up to the standards of an iconic institution, how they survive the pressures and relentlessly push themselves to reach the top ranks of American medicine, supplies the beating heart of this gripping narrative.\n\nReaders accompany Muñoz as he interacts with his mentors, diagnoses and treats patients, counsels worried family members, and struggles to stay awake for days and nights on end. Lives are saved—and sometimes lost. But the rewards are immediate and the incentives powerful. As Muñoz confides after helping to rescue one man from the throes of a heart attack: “I knew where I wanted to be: not watching but doing, on the side of the glass where I can help shape a patient’s fate. I would be a cardiologist.”\n\nA unique yet universal story about striving to be the best in a high-risk, high-impact field, Alpha Docs provides fresh perspective on the state of America’s healthcare system as it captures all the fulfillment and frustrations of life as a doctor in the twenty-first century.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": "https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Alpha-Docs/Daniel-Muñoz/Q215493640?id=9240744276881"},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/alpha-docs-dan-munoz/1110980293?ean=9781588369536"},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Alpha-Docs-Cardiologist-Daniel-Muñoz-ebook/dp/B00PEPS8VO/ref=sr_1_1?crid=14RRF0LGQB3C3&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.q13pKX9J_wrrv-18eDAGXwXVC6q51CsQi207b7PGtGhk9wsr0SnNkJylTSQKUVYwqWLnSSCxsVniS1GRGeVswGrQXkY4kCo50VxgHAZh8BaDURYtlBMm9I_S9-dNjXkF5qHtus_U83br4hATfx-hjw5Sccm0FcB1iQAgQbHOmiyGLxCDBAPU89IC9l8sHlMFhwm6EOllt50XiUhMLlLWUj_Mr7QOkChT9Fdz2_XdZuo.SQOTNhOOephmTBbPzWlPxbYdb_n3pX_CdMl0LSk6IWM&dib_tag=se&keywords=alpha+docs&qid=1725633124&s=digital-text&sprefix=alpha+docs%2Cdigital-text%2C703&sr=1-1"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": "https://books.apple.com/us/book/alpha-docs/id976993118"},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/book/9798200010721"},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},
{"classmate":{"firstName":"Meghan","lastName":"Weir"},"title":"Between Expectations: Lessons from a Pediatric Residency","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81FgH8SyErL._SL1500_.jpg","dateString":"2011-03-01T00:00:00","description":"When Dr. Meghan Weir first dons her scrubs and steps onto the floor of Children’s Hospital Boston as a newly minted resident, her head is packed with medical-school-textbook learning. She knows the ins and outs of the human body, has memorized the correct way to perform hundreds of complicated procedures, and can recite the symptoms of any number of diseases by rote. But none of that has truly prepared her for what she is about to experience.\n\nFrom the premature infants Dr. Weir is expected to care for on her very first day of residency to the frustrating teenagers who visit the ER at three in the morning for head colds, each day brings with it new challenges and new lessons. Dr. Weir learns that messiness, fear, and uncertainty live beneath the professional exterior of the doctor’s white coat. Yet, in addition to the hardships, the practice of medicine comes with enormous rewards of joy, camaraderie, and the triumph of healing.\n\nThe three years of residency—when young doctors who have just graduated from medical school take on their own patients for the first time—are grueling in any specialty. But there is a unique challenge to dealing with patients too young to describe where it hurts, and it is not just having to handle their parents. In Between Expectations: Lessons from a Pediatric Residency, Dr. Weir takes readers into the nurseries, ICUs, and inpatient rooms of one of the country’s busiest hospitals for children, revealing a world many of us never get to see. With candor and humility, she explores the many humbling lessons that all residents must learn: that restraint is sometimes the right treatment option, no matter how much you want to act; that some patients, even young teenagers, aren’t interested in listening to the good advice that will make their lives easier; that parents ultimately know their own children far better than their doctors ever will.\n\nDr. Weir’s thoughtful prose reveals how exhaustion and doubt define the residency experience just as much as confidence and action do. Yet the most important lesson that she learns through the months and years of residency is that having a good day on the floor does not always mean that a patient goes home miraculously healed—more often than not, success is about a steady, gradual discovery of strength. By observing the children, the parents, and other hospital staff who painstakingly provide care each day, Dr. Weir finds herself finally developing into the physician (and the parent) she hopes to become. These stories—sometimes funny, sometimes haunting—expose the humanity that is so often obscured by the doctor’s white coat.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": "https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Between-Expectations/Meghan-Weir/9781439189085?id=9240744276881"},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/between-expectations-meghan-weir/1100366271?ean=9781439189085"},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Between-Expectations-Lessons-Pediatric-Residency-ebook/dp/B0043RSJMW/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3LNUN7KLHBW7X&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.H3ITova5oHcDZWsCkI51Ag.yS_AlMxUNAknYXqi5t4jWn5x50qCXb1OQUO2btqBdmU&dib_tag=se&keywords=Between+Expectations%3A+Lessons+from+a+Pediatric+Residency&qid=1725633369&s=digital-text&sprefix=between+expectations+lessons+from+a+pediatric+residency%2Cdigital-text%2C101&sr=1-1"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": "https://books.apple.com/us/book/between-expectations/id394348382"},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/book/9781439189085"},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

She was one of the first female delegates to the United Nations, and she played a central role in Britain’s postwar Labour government. In Laura Beers’s account of Wilkinson’s remarkable life, we have a richly detailed portrait of a time when Left-leaning British men and women from a range of backgrounds sought to reshape domestic, imperial, and international affairs.\n\nWilkinson is best remembered as the leader of the Jarrow Crusade, the 300-mile march of two hundred unemployed shipwrights and steelworkers to petition the British government for assistance. But this was just one small part of Red Ellen’s larger transnational fight for social justice. She was involved in a range of campaigns, from the quest for official recognition of the Spanish Republican government, to the fight for Indian independence, to the effort to smuggle Jewish refugees out of Germany.\n\nDuring Wilkinson’s lifetime, many British radicals viewed themselves as members of an international socialist community, and some, like her, became involved in socialist, feminist, and pacifist movements that spanned the globe. By focusing on the extent to which Wilkinson’s activism transcended Britain’s borders, Red Ellen adjusts our perception of the British Left in the early twentieth century.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": "https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Red-Ellen/Laura-Beers/9780674971523?id=9240744276881"},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/red-ellen-laura-beers/1123661979?ean=9780674971523"},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Red-Ellen-Laura-Beers-ebook/dp/B01L7NJO6O/ref=sr_1_1?crid=JQIRAURX7JYL&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.C93iywxmgW7eRoh8XcR7Du-gBdnY9K-69J4fIWuSyPy6-JHfigCsJ77LFMFsbZHFoegPhuUQkm26xsI2BcgvFCI7XNW6P7NTiJ_Z2Fj7AMKKPVXJAb_aHwNQZNJMovRElzkwLuTkc_0KAqLjJYevJ7AW9t358bqfFm9S2Ayn1atnTEdNcg9D3_koH877zCXB.v3wJwRF5gfcQzrKPkiuZfR7SU17pDqAMVRZf4hFR7w0&dib_tag=se&keywords=laura+beers+red+ellen&qid=1725761787&sprefix=laura+beers+red+ellen%2Caps%2C77&sr=8-1"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": "https://books.apple.com/us/book/red-ellen/id1160948753"},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": "https://bookshop.org/book/9780674971523"},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

The growing centrality of the commercial media to democratic life quickly became evident as organizations of all stripes saw its potential to reach new voters. The new media presented both an exciting opportunity and a significant challenge to the new Labour Party.\n\nLaura Beers traces Labour’s rise as a movement for working-class men to its transformation into a national party that won a landslide victory in 1945. Key to its success was a skillful media strategy designed to win over a broad, diverse coalition of supporters. Though some in the movement harbored reservations about a socialist party making use of the “capitalist” commercial media, others advocated using the media to hammer home the message that Labour represented not only its traditional base but also women, office workers, and professionals. Labour’s national leadership played a pivotal role in the effective use of popular journalism, the BBC, and film to communicate its message to the public. In the process Labour transformed not only its own national profile but also the political process in general.\n\nNew Labour’s electoral success of the late twentieth century was due in no small part to its grasp of media communication. This insightful book reminds us that the importance of the mass media to Labour’s political fortunes is by no means a modern phenomenon.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": "https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Your-Britain/Laura-Beers/9780674050020?id=9240744276881"},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/your-britain-laura-beers/1101466253?ean=9780674050020"},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Your-Britain-Media-Making-Labour/dp/0674050029/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.sTeG4pprCA4P_O-juVGnZs5rBaA8s3ytY6FiERoyUCXTrlRVe23gZbQic1t8cQx_oegPhuUQkm26xsI2BcgvFI6T7vy2q27VEHCf-z6pJd3wP1e4L6atg4llZ5RJWFdtpbrt6oQwx8AHMOargi6wMIh4tuvCPH1DbpX-kqJg0WatOgSAaXqzOiabhbvFVnwykvnqSTwczE43CPK3iz2uxXF9ANeWovFyP8u3B4JvO-s.mOBiOuXpi4_mWkZIkcrOWYOQHd60SsAvRDDH4Fu4Mf0&qid=1725761957&sr=8-1"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": "https://books.apple.com/us/book/your-britain/id6476231242"},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": null},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},

As politicians at home and abroad sought to legitimise their position, new efforts were made to conceptualise nationality and citizenship, with attempts to engage the public using mass media and greater emphasis on governing in the public interest.\n\nBrave New World reappraises the domestic and imperial history of Britain in the interwar period, investigating how ‘nation building’ was given renewed impetus by the upheavals of WWI. The essays in this collection address how new technologies and approaches to governance were used to forge new national identities both at home and in the empire, covering a wide range of issues from the representation of empire on film to the convergence of politics and ‘star culture’.\n\nThe book is an invaluable resource for scholars of British social, political and imperial history, as well as being of interest to the general reader.","links":[{"source": "BAM", "url": null},{"source": "Barnes & Noble", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Brave-New-World-Democratic-Nation-Building-ebook/dp/B009G2XC3A?ref_=ast_author_dp"},{"source": "Apple Books", "url": null},{"source": "Bookshop", "url": null},{"source": "Apple Music", "url": null},{"source": "Spotify", "url": null},{"source": "Amazon Music", "url": null},{"source": "Disney Plus", "url": null},{"source": "Apple TV", "url": null},{"source": "Vimeo", "url": null},{"source": "YouTube", "url": null},{"source": "Netflix", "url": null},]},]
